        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Bo Ne, or <i>Vietnamese Sizzling Steak and Eggs</i>, is a common Vietnamese breakfast dish but can be enjoyed at any time during the day.<br>
            The name literally translates to "dodging beef" as in dodging the splatter of butter and oil while the 
            steak is sizzling on the hot plate that it's served on.<br>
            Bo means "cow" and Ne means "to dodge".<br>
            Bo Ne typically consists of steak, eggs, SPAM (or xa xiu), with Vietnamese baguette, pate, bo (Vietnamese mayo), and some
            sort of salad on the side.<br>
